<h1>Configuring an Open-Source Linux Distribution for Machine Learning</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I set up a secure and efficient machine learning environment on an open-source Linux distribution (Ubuntu 24.04) by installing Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NumPy. The setup also focused on security, including the creation of a dedicated user for ML tasks, configuring a firewall with UFW, and enhancing protection with Fail2Ban and unattended upgrades. This project provides a solid foundation for ML development with both functionality and security in mind.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- Python 3 
- Pip 
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas 
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) 
- Fail2Ban 
- Unattended-Upgrades 
- OpenSSH 
- User Management Tools
